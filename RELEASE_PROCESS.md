# How to cut a Pony release

This document is aimed at members of the Pony team who might be cutting a release of Pony. It serves as a checklist that can take you through doing a release step-by-step.

## Prerequisites for doing any release

In order to do a release, you absolutely must have:

* Commit access to the `ponyc` repo

While not strictly required, you life will be made much easier if you:

* Have a [bintray account](https://bintray.com/) and have been granted access `pony-language` organization by a "release admin".
* Have read and write access to the ponylang [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org) account
* Have read and write access to the ponylang [appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com) account

## Prerequisites for specific releases

Before getting started, you will need a number for the version that you will be releasing as well as an agreed upon "golden commit" that will form the basis of the release.  Any commit is eligible to be a "golden commit" so long as:

* It passed all CI checks
* We were able to build "ponyc-master binaries" for it.

### Validating "ponyc-master binaries"

Currently, we validate binaries for RPM, Deb and Windows packaging. Follow the bintray links below to verify each of the package. You are looking under "Versions" for a successfully created package for the "golden commit". In the case of RPM and Deb, the versions look something like:

`0.3.1-1885.8a8ee28`

where the 

`8a8ee28`

is the sha for the commit we built from.

For windows, version look something like:

`ponyc-master-0.3.1-1526.8a8ee28`

where the 

`8a8ee28`

is the sha for the commit we built from.

* [RPM](https://bintray.com/pony-language/ponyc-rpm/ponyc-master)
* [Debian](https://bintray.com/pony-language/ponyc-debian/ponyc-master)
* [Windows](https://bintray.com/pony-language/ponyc-win/ponyc-master)

### Validate external services are functional

We rely on both Travis CI and Appveyor as part of our release process. Both need to be up and functional in order to do a release. Check the status of each before starting a release. If either is reporting issues, push the release back a day or until whenever they both are reporting no problems.

* [Travis CI Status](https://www.traviscistatus.com)
* [Appveyor Status](https://appveyor.statuspage.io)

### A GitHub issue exists for the release

All releases should have a corresponding issue in the [ponyc repo](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues). This issue should be used to communicate the progress of the release (updated as checklist steps are completed). You can also use the issue to notify other pony team members of problems.

## Releasing

For the duration of this document, we will pretend the "golden commit" version is `8a8ee28`, the version is `0.3.1`, and our release date is 2016-01-15. Any place you see those values, please substitute your own version.

### Update the GitHub issue

Leave a comment on the GitHub issue for this release to let everyone know that you are starting.

### Update VERSION and CHANGELOG

* git pull
* git checkout -b release-0.3.1

#### Update the VERSION

In the root of the ponyc repo is a file called `VERSION`. You should update the version number therein to your version number, for example: `0.3.1`.

#### Update the CHANGELOG

We maintain all changes in our CHANGELOG. At the time we do a release, we need to "roll" the CHANGELOG from one version to another. Open up CHANGELOG.md and you will see a series of changes that are in this commit under a section that says:

`## [unreleased] - unreleased`

This should be changed to:

`## [0.3.1] - 2016-01-15`

If any of the sections, "Added", "Fixed" or "Changed" is empty, delete it.

### Merge into release

* git checkout release
* git merge release-0.3.1

### Tag the release

* git tag 0.3.1

### Push to the release branch

* git push origin
* git push origin 0.3.1

### Update CHANGELOG for new entries

We are in a slightly precarious state here, someone might have merged since we started and updated the CHANGELOG on master. Verify that hasn't happened then merge your change to CHANGELOG into master.

* git checkout master
* git merge release-0.3.1

Now add a new "unreleased" section to the change log. Above the `## [0.3.1] - 2016-01-15` add the following:

```
## [unreleased] - unreleased

### Fixed

### Added

### Changed

```

If anything was merged into the CHANGELOG since versioned it, move the new additions to the appropriate section of the new "unreleased" section. Commit your changes and push to master.

### Update the GitHub issue

Leave a comment on the GitHub issue for this release to let everyone know you are done versioning the CHANGELOG and VERSION and that they are updated on `master`.

### "Update" PRs for CHANGELOG

Go through all open PRs and check to see if they are updating the CHANGELOG. If they are, leave a note asking them to merge the latest CHANGELOG into their branch because of the recent versioning for release and to move their additions into the appropriate area of "unreleased".

### Add CHANGELOG entries to GitHub releases

By now GitHub should have a listing of this new release under [releases](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/releases). Click the `0.3.1` then do "Edit Release". Paste the CHANGELOG entries for this release into the box and update.

### Update Homebrew

Fork the [homebrew-core repo](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core) and then clone it locally. You are going to be editing "Formula/ponyc.rb". Make sure you do your changes on a branch:

* git checkout -n ponyc-0.3.1

HomeBrew has [directions](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#submit-a-123-version-upgrade-for-the-foo-formula) on what specifically you need to update in a formula to account for an upgrade. If you are on OSX and are unsure of how to get the SHA of the release .tar.gz, download the release file (make sure it does unzip it) and run `shasum -a 256 ponyc-0.3.1.tar.gz`. If you are on OSX, its quite possible it will try to unzip the file on your. In Safari, right clicking and selecting "Download Linked File" will get your the complete .tar.gz.

After updating the ponyc formula, push to your fork and open a PR against homebrew-core.

### Update the GitHub issue

Leave a comment on the GitHub issue for this release letting everyone know that the Homebrew formula has been updated and a PR issued. Leave a link to your open PR.

### "Kick off" the Gentoo release

Leave a comment on the GitHub issue for this release letting @stefantalpalaru know that a release is underway. He maintains the Gentoo release. We think it involves magic, but aren't really sure.

### Wait on Travis and Appveyor

During the time since you push to the release branch, Travis CI and Appveyor have been busy building release artifacts. This can take up to a couple hours depending on how busy they are. Periodically check bintray to see if the releases are there yet.

* [RPM](https://bintray.com/pony-language/ponyc-rpm/ponyc-release)
* [Debian](https://bintray.com/pony-language/ponyc-debian/ponyc-release)
* [Windows](https://bintray.com/pony-language/ponyc-win/ponyc-release)

The pattern for releases is similar as what we previously saw. In the case of RPM and Deb, the versions look something like:

`0.3.1-1885.8a8ee28`

where the 

`8a8ee28`

is the sha for the commit we built from.

For windows, version look something like:

`ponyc-release-0.3.1-1526.8a8ee28`

where the 

`8a8ee28`

### Wait on Homebrew

Periodically check on your Homebrew PR. They have a CI process and everything should flow through smoothly. If it doesn't attempt to fix the problem. If you can't fix the problem, leave a comment on the GitHub issue for this release asking for assistance.

### Update the GitHub issue as needed

At this point we are basically waiting on Travis, Appveyor and Homebrew. As each finishes, leave a note on the GitHub issue for this release letting everyone know where we stand status wise. For example: "Release 0.3.1 is now available via Homebrew"

### Inform #ponylang

Once Travis, Appveyor and Homebrew are all finished, drop a note in the #ponylang IRC channel letting everyone know that the release is out and include a link the release notes so everyone can see the CHANGELOG.

### Inform pony-user

Once Travis, Appveyor and Homebrew are all finished, send an email to the pony user mailing list letting everyone know that the release is out and include a link the release notes so everyone can see the CHANGELOG.
